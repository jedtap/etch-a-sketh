# etch-a-sketh

Hi there! This project is to have an online version of an etch-a-sketch. This will showcase what I learn in using html, css, and javascript. I am very grateful to learn all of this from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Feel free to contact me for any parttime/fulltime opportunities, I love to learn on how I can help you guys out!
